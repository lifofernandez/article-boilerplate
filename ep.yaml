  abstract: "A review of prior, relevant literature is an essential feature of any\
    \ academic project. An effective review creates a firm foundation for advancing\
    \ knowledge. It facilitates theory development, closes areas where a plethora\
    \ of research exists, and uncovers areas where research is needed. In the information\
    \ systems (IS) field, we see few published review articles. As a result, the progress\
    \ of our field is impeded. To address this concern, the MIS Quarterly launched\
    \ MISQ Review several years ago. The clear intention was to accelerate the accumulation\
    \ of IS knowledge. A particular goal was to advance the state of theory within\
    \ the IS field. The stated purpose of MISQ Review is to \u2026promote MIS research\
    \ by publishing articles that conceptualize research areas and survey and synthesize\
    \ prior research. These articles will provide important input in setting directions\
    \ for future research. 1"

  abstract: While there has been an increasing number of studies on smart cities,
    there are still issues in assessment and governance of these cities. This study
    aims to analyze and provide insights into the research done in smart city maturity
    models by conducting a systemically review of related literature. The study discusses
    and analyzes 22 maturity frameworks from the peer-reviewed articles. The discussion
    also included the alignment of the smart city to the United Nations sustainable
    development goals. The analysis shows that there is an increased emphasis on the
    development of maturity models over the years 2011-2018 However, only 9 out of
    the 22 models were comprehensive, other models were focused on specific aspects
    such as citizens, data and IoT. In addition, 50% of the models from the literature
    included components related to technology but most of the models lacked assessment
    of the environmental aspects. This review indicates the need for a comprehensive
    smart cities' maturity model to assess the cities in their smartness transformation.

  abstract: Smart city represents a new future framework which integrates multiple
    information and communication technology (ICT), which provides solution to cope
    with urban challenges and at the same time to improve the quality of life of the
    citizens. However, it is still an unclear concept with no standardised nomenclature
    that could be effectively describing itself and lacking in standardised criteria
    and framework to visualise the concept. This paper aims to review smart city literature
    to achieve the understandings on the fundamentals of smart city. The research
    procedure focuses on the dimensions of the smart city. The studies selected from
    two major databases; Scopus and Science Direct. The selection process involves
    searching for literature sources and screening and filtering the studies based
    on titles, abstracts, and full-text reading. Final 28 documents are selected and
    adopted in this study. Based on the review, it is identified that there are 11
    dimensions that contributes to the development of smart cities; smart economy,
    smart governance, smart people, smart environment, smart infrastructure, smart
    technology, smart living, smart mobility, smart water and waste, smart security
    and smart agriculture. Thus, the findings provide insights for scholars researching
    on the subject, and the parties considering applying them into practice.

  abstract: This paper systematically reviews the top 200 Google Scholar publications
    in the area of smart city with the aid of data-driven methods from the fields
    natural language processing and time series forecasting. Specifically, our algorithm
    crawls the textual information of the considered articles and uses the created
    ad-hoc database to identify the most relevant streams &ldquo;smart infrastructure&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;smart economy &amp; policy&rdquo;, &ldquo;smart technology&rdquo;, &ldquo;smart
    sustainability&rdquo;, and &ldquo;smart health&rdquo;. Next, we automatically
    assign each manuscript into these subject areas by dint of several interdisciplinary
    scientific methods. Each stream is evaluated in a deep-dive analysis by (i) creating
    a word cloud to find the most important keywords, (ii) examining the main contributions,
    and (iii) applying time series methodologies to determine the past and future
    relevance. Due to our large-scaled literature, an in-depth evaluation of each
    stream is possible, which ultimately reveals strengths and weaknesses. We hereby
    acknowledge that smart sustainability will come to the fore in the next years&mdash;this
    fact confirms the current trend, as minimizing the required input of energy, water,
    food, waste, heat output and air pollution is becoming increasingly important.

  abstract: Many scholars are not well trained in conducting a standalone literature
    review, a scholarly paper that in its entirety summarizes and synthesizes knowledge
    from a prior body of research. Numerous guides that exist for information systems
    (IS) research mainly concentrate on only certain parts of the process; few span
    the entire process. This paper introduces the rigorous, standardized methodology
    for the systematic literature review (also called systematic review) to IS scholars.
    This comprehensive guide extends the base methodology from the health sciences
    and other fields with numerous adaptations to meet the needs of methodologically
    diverse fields such as IS research, especially those that involve including and
    synthesizing both quantitative and qualitative studies. Moreover, this guide provides
    many examples from IS research and provides references to guides with further
    helpful details for conducting a rigorous and valuable literature review. Although
    tailored to IS research, it is sufficiently broad to be applicable and valuable
    to scholars from any social science field.

  abstract: 'Background: A mapping study provides a systematic and objective procedure

    have been when used for software engineering topics, and to identify the specific
    challenges that they present. Method: We have conducted an informal review of
    a number of mapping studies in software engineering, describing their main characteristics
    and the forms of analysis employed. Results: We examine the experiences and outcomes
    from six mapping studies, of which four are published. From these we note a recurring
    theme about the problems of classification and a preponderance of ''gaps'' in
    the set of empirical studies. Conclusions: We identify our challenges as improving
    classification guidelines, encouraging better reporting of primary studies, and
    argue for identifying some ''empirical grand challenges'' for software engineering

  abstract: With the predicted world population growth of 83 million people per year
    (increasing 1.09% year on year) compounded with a strong trend for migration to
    urban centres, there is a developing interest by academics, industry and government
    to the digitalisation of the built environment and its potential impact on private
    enterprises, public services and the broader context of society. The governments
    around the world and others are aiming to guide and standardise this process by
    developing an array of standards to support this digitalisation, most notably
    on Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Smart Cities Framework. Furthermore,
    the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) is creating a highly flexible,
    dynamic and accessible platform for the exchange capture and of information. There
    is a risk that this information on the built environment is quickly becoming unmanageable,
    and the value of that information is quickly becoming lost. This paper presents
    a smart asset alignment framework that creates an alignment between the information
    captured at the infrastructure asset level and citizen requirements within a Smart
    City framework. The framework contributes to the debate on designing and developing
    Smart City solutions in a way that will deliver value to the citizens.

  abstract: The level of urbanization, which may impact on urban problems, could be
    resolved through city development supported by the advanced information technology
    to build the smart(er) city. However, generally, a smart city is still developed
    and implemented sporadically, it does not yet adopt a particular framework. Currently,
    there is a limited conceptual analysis and integrated template, as well as a limited
    framework based on the regulations issues in Indonesia. Therefore, it is considered
    necessary to develop a conceptual framework of the smart city for development.
    The study was conducted based on synthesized and aggregated literature review
    to build a new conceptual framework. The analysis of literature showed a complementary
    existing smart city framework, including city services (basic services, non-basic
    services, and optional services); city resources (suprastructure, infrastructure,
    and infostructure); city (enterprise) architecture; and city goals (livability,
    workability, and sustainability). This research contributes to wider insights
    of smart city reference model for both Indonesia and other developing countries.

  abstract: 'This paper contributes to the philosophical foundations of conceptual
    modeling by addressing a number of foundational questions such as: What is a conceptual
    model? Among models used in computer science, which are conceptual, and which
    are not? How are conceptual models different from other models used in the Sciences
    and Engineering? The paper takes a stance in answering these questions and, in
    order to do that, it draws from a broad literature in philosophy, cognitive science,
    Logics, as well as several areas of Computer Science (including Databases, Software
    Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Information Systems Engineering, among others).
    After a brief history of conceptual modeling, the paper addresses the aforementioned
    questions by proposing a characterization of conceptual models with respect to
    conceptual semantics and ontological commitments. Finally, we position our work
    w.r.t. to a "Reference Framework for Conceptual" modeling recently proposed in
    the literature.'

    important modeling problems in many domains. With a goal of articulating the breadth
    and depth of the field, our initial work focused on the many implicit and explicit
    definitions of conceptual modeling, resulting in the Characterizing Conceptual
    Modeling (CCM) framework. In this paper, we focus on conceptual modeling research,
    presenting a Characterizing Conceptual Model Research (CCMR) framework and a series
    of evaluations to assess the coverage and usability of CCMR, the utility and independence
    of the individual fields in the framework, and likelihood of consistent use.
